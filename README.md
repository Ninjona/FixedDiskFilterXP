A modified version of the Hitachi microdrive filter driver that allows USB flash drives and other removable storage devices to be recognized as fixed disks in Windows. This enables multiple partitions, write caching, and other fixed-disk functionalities. The modification uses a universal approach (USBSTOR\GenDisk) to work with most USB drives without requiring individual device IDs.
